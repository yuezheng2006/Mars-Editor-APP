/**
 * Let the local claude / codex edit drafts inside this workspace.

 * user's machine, just moved next to the editor, which saves the "switch to a
 * terminal, cd over, read the file name out to it" steps. Whose quota it runs
 * on is not decided here either: whatever the CLI itself is configured with,
 * subscription or key, is what it uses (that is exactly what switchers like
 * cc-switch change), and the panel only surfaces what it reports on startup.
 *
 * Edits do not flow back through this path: the agent writes .md files on disk
 * and the watcher notices them as usual. So the panel only ever shows what it
 * said and which file it touched — the left-hand side is the authority on what
 * the body actually looks like.
 *
 * The two CLIs get separate session areas: they are two processes that know
 * nothing about each other, claude cannot read what codex said, and laying
 * them out on one timeline would only suggest that they can. What genuinely
 * passes between them is the .md files on disk — that is the shared context.
 *
 * "Collapse" only hides, never unmounts: a run in flight must not become an
 * orphaned process because you wanted the space back, and reopening should
 * still show the last exchange. Only a real unmount (switching workspaces,
 * closing the window) kills it.
